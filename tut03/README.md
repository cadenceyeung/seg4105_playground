### Summary
This podcast talks about pitches in the context of shape up. A pitch is a document that outlines a new feature or product idea. It lets the team know what needs to be done, why it's being done, and potentially how we can solve the problem. This will serve as a guide for the team.

Anyone can write ideas, however it is up to the person responsible for prioritizing the work to write a formalized pitch. Then, the team will take the pitch and decide what work needs to be done to execute the idea from the pitch.

It is also important not to put too much detail into the pitch. It should give a direction without being too specific. Rabbit holes are project elements that can cause extra work and complexity without adding any real value. Science projects are pitches that are unlikely to succeed and are used to explore ideas that we are uncertain of. 

Tracer bullets are used when we are uncertain about the scope or duration of a project. It's almost like a short free trial period, where we have a short amount of time to explore a problem before committing to a full project.

Finally, autonomy, mastery, and purpose have great importance in the shape up process. They allow the team to make decisions and find creative solutions, while maintaining within the area defined by the pitch.
