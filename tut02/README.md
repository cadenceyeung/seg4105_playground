## Chapter 2
When it comes to the shaping technique, people often make the mistake of being too concrete or too vague. When it's too concrete (i.e., creating wireframes straight off the bat), there is no room for creative design and estimation errors can also happen because of hidden details and complexities. When it's too vague (i.e., using words too abstractly), team members will have a lack of understanding and be unsure about the project details, scope, tradeoffs, etc.

The principles of shaping include setting clear boundaries, outlining the solution at a higher level, assess risks and any ambiguous aspects, and create a pitch to summarize the scope of the problem and solution.

## Chapter 3
The first step in shaping is to set boundaries, where you define the scope of the project and the restrictions. You also need to define whether this is project needs a lot or little commitment. The project scope needs to be restricted based on the time to promote decision-making and avoid going beyond the scope. Try and avoid committing to ideas too quickly and instead explore and understand the idea thoroughly before committing to it. Setting boundaries is the foundation for the rest of the shaping process.

## Chapter 4
In this step, we are going to define the actual elements of the solution. We need to make sure to have only the necessary information and abstraction in our solution. To ensure this step is executed correctly, we can use two different techniques: breadboarding and fat marker sketches. 

Breadboarding is about identifying the key elements and how they work together to make the solution work, without diving deep into the visual design. Fat marker sketches are about creating rough sketches that give you an idea of the arrangement of the elements rather than the small details of the solution. This phase will help form the project solution while also allowing for room for creative decisions later on. This step allows you to find the problems and hardships of the project before diving deep into one solution.

## Chapter 5
This step allows you to eliminate any risks in the project. These problems and risks can cause the failure of a project. To avoid this, we need to make the project as rabbit-hole free as possible.

To do this, we have to find any potential rabbit holes, challenges, ambiguities, unknowns, etc. during the shaping process. We also have to restrict the project by stating any use cases or features that are outside of the scope of the project. We also may need to cut down on elements that we don't need and also ask for feedback from technical experts to confirm that what we are assuming is correct or not. Once we do that, we can move onto the pitch phase.
