## Feature Breakdown
This feature will allow the user to send customized emails. Meaning, they will be able to send out emails to certain people at a certain time, essentially batching and scheduling emails to be sent.

The user can see a list of people to send emails to (people who have signed up for the experiment), select who they want to send the email to, select what time they want to send the email, then confirm sending the email.
