### Notes from before Tutorial

#### Automated Email Sending Customization (Me)

- Feasible, but is it really necessary?
- Is there a cost rabbit hole involved? What if the user exceeds the number of free emails?
- Overall, good idea, but takes a long time to set up, has a upper bound number of emails before needing to charge for money, and not necessary at the moment.

#### Unity VR (Farina)

- Is it really feasible? Where are we going to get the funding expensive headsets?
- Is it necessary if we already have the game running on a laptop?
- Is there a connectivity/integration rabbit hole? Will there be any issues with Unity in a VR environment? Do we need extra equipment for the handles?
- Overall, I think it's a cool idea but kind of expensive and unnecessary if we have the game on a laptop already.

#### User Uploaded Obstactles (Dillon)

- Yes it's feasible, but is it necessary if we already have all the obstacles preloaded?
- Might be good if the user needs to add more obstacles later on. But how likely is this to happen?
- Rabbit hole: will the software for obstacles ever be updated so it's incompatible with the game?
- Overall, I think this is a good idea but unnecessary if all the obstacles the user needs are already uploaded.

#### Experiment Progress Viewer (Daniel)

- Yes it's feasible. Both the frontend and backend developers are fully capable of implementing this feature.
- Rabbit hole: what if the experiment laptop crashes during the experiment? What happens to the display of the progress?
- Overall, I think this is a great idea. It fits the appetite, the problem matters, and the solution is attractive and makes sense/ is possible to implement right now.

#### Experiment Data Download (Thuy-Vi)

- It's kind of unfeasible in my opinion because we would need the data to transfer through a third party server and we don't have the capabilities or the money for any potential costs that the server comes with.
- Rabbit hole: what if the data is faulty, like if the laptop crashes halfway through the experiment? 
- Overall, I think it is convenient to have, but just not really feasible to implement as of right now.

#### Level Editor Application (Ralf)

- Yes, it's feasible to implement eventually, but in terms of team members, no one is able to work on this feature, as we have other tasks to prioritize first. This project might not even be able to be completed within 6 weeks. It's pretty big.
- I'm not sure how often the user will benefit from this feature. I don't think they will be editing the level that much. There is probably other better ways of doing this too that currently exist.
- Overall, good idea, but I don't think it's the right time to invest in this pitch right now.

### Rough Meeting Notes
- Unity VR
    - VR mode to existing laptop mode
    - Hardware is a big issue
    - Good for inclusiveness (people who can't use a laptop)
    - EXPENSIVE!
    - Not the right time to consider this right now.
- Level Editor
    - Separate Unity app
    - Easier customization for client
    - Not possible to do in 6 months
- User Uploaded Obstacles
    - Upload obstacle assets to Unity
    - Not needed at the moment
    - Cool feature, not now
- Email Sending Customization
    - Automate sending batch emails
    - Not needed right now. User doesn't have enough participants to worry about that right now.
    - Good for future implementation, just not now.
- Experiment Data Download
    - Downloading data from experiments through frontend
    - Needs backend implementation too
    - More for convenience but not necessary 
- Experiment Progress Viewer
    - Allows client to view experiment progress
    - View live experiments
    - Stale experiments
    - Feasible and would greatly benefit our client right now.

- TODO:
    - Clean up notes
    - Combine notes with team for D2
